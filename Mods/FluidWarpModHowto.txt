Place one providing input fluid, and another one with an output pipe. (Do not plug both (input/output) pipes in the same gate).

Use the Channel slider in the Stargate Menu to tune both to the same channel.

(The fluid is stored in a dimension with unlimited storage. This storage is deleted where you exit the game.)

You can place two stargates with one input each and one stargate with one output pipe then as example:
two inputs send two packets of 1kg and 2kg, then the ouput will put in the pipe two packets of 1kg and 2kg sequentially.
